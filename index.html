                <h3>Napping: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
                <p>Whenever I'm bored it's usually the first thing that comes to mind, just sleep it out. You can say I've got a knack for it.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Procrastinating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
                <p>Been really good at it since Highschool.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Getting things done on time: ⭐️⭐️</h3>
                <p>Usually the result of being such a good procrastinator.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Cooking: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
                <p>I pretty much had to be decent at it since my parents are rarely at home.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Break Dancing: ⭐️</h3>
                <p>Come on. Did you really think I'm good at dancing? Much less break dancing.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Tech Repairing: ⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
                <p>I'm not very good at it but I do like doing it especially when I was younger.</p>

              <h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
              <p>Another one of my favorites. I sometimes spend the majority of the day with this one.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Napping</h3>
              <p>One of my favorite past time if I'm not playing video games or whatnot.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Contemplating about life and doing nothing about it</h3>
              <p>I have no idea why I do this.</p>

                <p>Back in Kindergarten, I remember not being able to introduce myself because I was so shy. Graduated in 2008.
                Next was my elementary years, the longest chapter of my education history (for now at least) and met a lot of good friends. Graduated in 2014.
                And then, there was my Junior Highschool Days. Met a lot of good friends but also the chapter with the most school dramas (a bit annoying to be completely honest). Graduated in 2018.
                This probably has the highest ratio of the fun that I have to years spent. It's only 2 years but the fun that I had felt way more than 2 years. Graduated in 2020.
                Could've been something really good if it wasn't for the pandemic. Undergraduate currently and hoping to graduate in 2024.</p>
